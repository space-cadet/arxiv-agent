# Integrated Code Rules and Memory Bank System, v6.1 (Hierarchical Memory Bank Augmented)

*Last Updated: April 22, 2025*

YOU WILL NEVER UPDATE ANY FILES, INCLUDING MEMORY BANK FILES, WITHOUT EXPLICIT USER APPROVAL
YOU WILL NEVER ADD NEW FEATURES WITHOUT APPROVAL
YOU WILL NEVER GENERATE ANY CODE WITHOUT APPROVAL
YOU WILL GO SLOW AND STEADY. WHEN YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING SLOW, GO EVEN SLOWER.

## 1. Unified System Purpose

- Balance task execution with project knowledge
- Maintain consistent coding standards
- Ensure project continuity across sessions
- Support multiple concurrent tasks

## 2. Hierarchical Memory Bank Structure

### 2.1 Overview

The hierarchical memory bank organizes files into a structured directory system to ensure efficient access and management of project knowledge. The structure is divided into tiers based on relevance and frequency of use.

### 2.2 Directory Structure

```
memory-bank/
├── activeContext.md      # Current task context
├── archive/              # Archived files
├── changelog.md          # Log of changes across sessions
├── component_index.md    # Index of all components with references
├── database/             # Hierarchical database for memory bank
├── edit_history.md       # File modification log (with task references)
├── errorLog.md           # Error tracking (with task references)
├── implementation-details/ # Detailed implementation notes
├── progress.md           # Implementation status
├── projectbrief.md       # Project overview
├── session_cache.md      # Multi-task session state
├── sessions/             # Individual session files by task
├── systemPatterns.md     # Architecture and design patterns
├── task_contexts/        # Context files for specific tasks
├── tasks/                # Individual task definition files
├── tasks.md              # Task registry and tracking
├── techContext.md        # Technical implementation details
├── templates/            # Template files for memory bank documents
└── TODO.md               # Project-wide TODO items and quick notes
```

### 2.3 File Relationships

- **Tasks**: Tracked in `tasks.md`, with detailed task definitions in the `/tasks/` directory. Related information in `session_cache.md`, `edit_history.md`, and `errorLog.md`.
- **Sessions**: Individual session files stored in `/sessions/` directory with task-specific session information, referenced from `session_cache.md`.
- **Task Contexts**: Stored in `/task_contexts/` directory, containing context-specific information for individual tasks.
- **Templates**: Stored in the `/templates/` directory and follow formats in section 9.
- **Component Index**: `component_index.md` maintains a registry of all project components with references to implementation files.
- **TODO**: `TODO.md` contains project-wide to-do items and quick notes that don't warrant full task creation.
- **Archive**: Contains archived files for long-term reference.
- **Implementation Details**: Stores detailed implementation notes and documentation.
- **Database**: Contains hierarchical database for memory bank organization.

### 2.4 Validation Rules

1. All files must have:
   - Clear header with last updated date
   - Consistent section formatting
   - Status indicators where applicable
   - Task ID references where applicable

2. Prohibited:
   - Unstructured notes
   - Redundant information
   - File-specific details in wrong documents
   - Missing task ID references

### 2.5 Maintenance Guidelines

* IMPORTANT: ALL file updates below require EXPLICIT user approval before implementation
* Update `tasks.md` only after receiving approval, whenever task status changes
* Update `edit_history.md` only after receiving approval, after each file change, with task ID reference
* Update `session_cache.md` only after receiving approval, when switching between tasks
* Review `errorLog.md` weekly, but make no modifications without approval
* Archive `session_cache.md` only after receiving approval, after all active tasks complete
* Keep `progress.md` organized by task ID, updating only with explicit approval

### 2.6 File Size Management Protocol

**NOTE: The following operations require explicit approval before implementation**

1. **Size-Based Rotation**:
   - Upper limit of 500 lines for `edit_history.md` and `errorLog.md`
   - Archive completed tasks after 30 days in `tasks.md`
   - When exceeding limit, move to `archive/` subfolder
   - Rename using format `edit_history_YYYY-MM.md`

## 3. Integration with Development Workflow

This system supports rapid task execution while maintaining documentation quality and balancing immediate needs with long-term project knowledge.

## 4. Tiered Knowledge Structure

Knowledge is organized in four tiers with task-oriented loading priorities:

1. **Bootstrap Tier (Minimal Required Knowledge)**
   - `bootstrap.md` - Core system structure
   - `tasks.md` - Registry of all tasks
   - `TODO.md` - Quick project-wide notes and to-do items
   - Access only when needed to understand command system or task structure

2. **Critical Tier (Task-Relevant Only)**
   - `activeContext.md` - Current state relevant to immediate task
   - `progress.md` - Status information needed for current step
   - `session_cache.md` - Task contexts for active and paused tasks
   - Individual task files in `/tasks/` directory - For current task details
   - Individual session files in `/sessions/` directory - For current session context
   - Task context files in `/task_contexts/` directory - For specific task contexts
   - `errorLog.md` - Record of errors (load when debugging)
   - `edit_history.md` - File modifications (load when context about recent changes needed)
   - Load only files directly relevant to current task step

3. **Essential Tier (Load Only When Required)**
   - `projectbrief.md` - Reference only when task scope is unclear
   - `component_index.md` - Reference only when component structure is needed
   - `.cursorrules` - Reference only when implementation patterns are needed
   - Load only when task requirements aren't clear from Critical tier

4. **Reference Tier (Avoid Unless Specifically Needed)**
   - `productContext.md` - Why and how the project works
   - `systemPatterns.md` - Architecture and design patterns
   - `techContext.md` - Technical implementation details
   - Implementation details in `/implementation-details/` directory
   - Load only specific files when directly relevant to current task step

## 5. Documentation Decision Framework

**IMPORTANT: All commands that modify files require explicit user approval before execution, unless such approval has already been explicitly given**

| Change Type | Documentation Requirements |
|-------------|----------------------------|
| Task creation | Update `tasks.md` with new task ID and details |
| Task status change | Update `tasks.md` with new status |
| Task switching | Update `session_cache.md` to preserve context |
| Interface changes | Update API docs, `activeContext.md` with task reference |
| Implementation details | Code comments only, `edit_history.md` with task ID |
| Architecture changes | Update `systemPatterns.md`, add task reference |
| New features | Update `progress.md`, `projectbrief.md` with task reference |
| Bug fixes | Update `progress.md` with task reference |
| Refactoring | Minimal documentation unless patterns change |
| Error resolution | Update `errorLog.md` with error details, fix, and task ID |
| File modification | Update `edit_history.md` with file changes and task ID |
| Multiple file edits | Update both `session_cache.md` and `edit_history.md` with task ID |
| Ongoing work | Update `session_cache.md` with clear "in progress" indicators (🔄) |

## 7. Integrated Workflows

### 7.1 Task-First Implementation Flow

1. Receive task → analyze minimal requirements, focus strictly on specified task → request approval to create or load task
2. After approval, check if task exists → create or load task
3. Analyze immediate task needs
4. Request approval to load minimal required context
5. After approval, load minimal required context
6. Present implementation plan and request approval before execution
7. After approval, execute first step
8. Request approval to update edit_history.md with task ID
9. After approval, update edit_history.md with task ID
10. For each additional step:
   1. Request approval to load context needed for that step
   2. After approval, load only context needed for that step
   3. Present implementation plan and request approval before execution
   4. After approval, execute step
   5. Request approval to update documentation with task ID
   6. After approval, update documentation with task ID
11. Request approval to mark complete or update session_cache.md
12. After approval, mark complete or update session_cache.md

### 7.2 Error Handling Flow

1. Identify error cause → **request approval before** implementing fix → **after approval** test
2. If fixed: **request approval to** document in errorLog.md with task ID, **then request approval to** update edit_history.md
3. If not fixed: return to identification step

## 8. Technical Implementation Standards

### 8.1 XML Tag Format

Tool use is formatted using XML-style tags:

```
<tool_name>
<parameter1_name>value1</parameter1_name>
<parameter2_name>value2</parameter2_name>
...
</tool_name>
```

### 8.2 File Operations

**IMPORTANT: All file operations require explicit user approval before execution**

**Note:** File editing and creation operations should be performed using the Desktop Commander (dc) MCP server. When editing files, prioritize using block edits (`edit_block` tool) to minimize token usage and ensure precise changes.

#### Reading Files

```
<read_file>
<path>src/main.js</path>
</read_file>
```

With line specifications:

```
<read_file>
<path>src/app.ts</path>
<start_line>46</start_line>
<end_line>68</end_line>
</read_file>
```

#### Searching Files

```
<search_files>
<path>.</path>
<regex>your-pattern-here</regex>
<file_pattern>*.ts</file_pattern>
</search_files>
```

#### Directory Listing

```
<list_files>
<path>.</path>
<recursive>false</recursive>
</list_files>
```

#### File Modification (Block Edit Format)

For precise, surgical modifications:

```
<edit_block>
<blockContent>File path here
<<<<<<< SEARCH
Original content to find
=======
New content to replace with
>>>>>>> REPLACE
</blockContent>
</edit_block>
```
