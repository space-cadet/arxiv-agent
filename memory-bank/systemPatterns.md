# Architecture and Design Patterns

## Core Principles

1. **KEEP IT REALLY FUCKING SIMPLE, STUPID (KIRFSS)**
   - No unnecessary abstractions
   - No premature optimization
   - No over-engineering
   - Just make it work first
   - If you think it's simple enough, make it simpler

## Implementation Patterns
- Direct FastAPI endpoints with minimal middleware
- Simple Streamlit frontend
- Only essential error handling
- Minimal state management

### Memory Bank System
- Hierarchical file organization
- Task-based tracking
- Session-based context management
- Comprehensive documentation approach

## Development Patterns
To be established during implementation.

## Documentation Patterns
Currently following memory bank system documentation patterns:
- Clear file headers with timestamps
- Consistent section formatting
- Status indicators where applicable
- Task ID references where appropriate
- Regular updates to change logs

## Notes
System patterns will be documented here as they are established during implementation.
