# T3: Simplify Backend Implementation
*Created: 2025-04-25*
*Status: ✅ Completed*

## Overview
Task to simplify the entire backend implementation following the KIRFSS principle (Keep It Really Fucking Simple, Stupid).

## Objectives
- ✅ Strip down backend to bare essentials
- ✅ Create minimal FastAPI endpoints
- ✅ Implement simple test suite with HTML reports
- ✅ Remove all unnecessary complexity

## Implementation Details
### Backend Changes
- Created minimal FastAPI implementation with core endpoints:
  - /papers/by-author
  - /papers/daily
  - Basic profile endpoints

### Test Implementation
- Simple test suite that verifies basic functionality
- Added HTML report generation
- Direct endpoint testing without mocks

## Key Files
- `backend/main.py` - Simplified FastAPI implementation
- `tests/test_api.py` - Basic test suite
- `tests/conftest.py` - Basic test configuration
- `pytest.ini` - HTML report configuration

## Dependencies
- Previous task T2 (Migrate to arxiv Python Package)

## Lessons Learned
- Over-engineering was preventing core functionality
- KIRFSS principle led to working implementation
- Simple implementation can be extended when needed, not before

## Resolution
Successfully simplified backend and test implementation. All core functionality working with minimal code.
